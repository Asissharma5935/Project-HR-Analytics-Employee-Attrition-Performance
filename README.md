Description:
Designed an interactive business intelligence dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to analyze key performance metrics. The project involved connecting and transforming raw datasets, performing data cleaning in Power Query Editor, and establishing data relationships using a star schema model. Built insightful visuals including bar charts, KPI cards, line graphs, slicers, and tables to represent:

-Revenue performance trends over time

-Top products by sales and profitability

-Customer segmentation by region or revenue

-Channel-wise order and profit distribution

Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures such as Total Revenue, Net Profit, Profit Margin, and Rank. Enabled dynamic filtering and interactive slicers to allow stakeholders to drill down into the data and gain actionable insights.
